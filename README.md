👋 Welcome to my monorepo! This is the home for all my personal and professional web projects, including my resume generator, portfolio website, and the tools that power them.

## What's Inside?

- **resume-generator** — An AI-powered app to help you craft beautiful resumes and cover letters.
- **website** — My personal website and portfolio, built with love and Next.js.
- **resume** — A library of reusable resume components and types.
- **hygraph-client** — A handy GraphQL client for fetching and managing resume data from Hygraph (GraphCMS).

## Getting Started

To get up and running with everything, just install all dependencies from the root:

```bash
yarn install
```

Each workspace has its own README with more details and setup instructions. Whether you're here to browse, contribute, or just get inspired, I'm glad you're here!

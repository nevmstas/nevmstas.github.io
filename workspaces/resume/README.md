# Resume Components

👔 This package contains reusable React components and types for building resumes.

## Why?

I wanted a flexible, beautiful way to render resumes across my apps. These components are designed to be shared between my resume generator and website, but you're welcome to use them too!

## What's Inside?

- `src/components/` — Header, skills, experience, and more
- `src/hooks/` — Custom React hooks for resume logic
- `src/theme/` — Theme and style definitions
- `src/types/` — TypeScript types for resume data

## How to Use

Import the components you need into your Next.js app or any React project. No standalone app here — just building blocks for your own creations.

## License

MIT — use, share, and improve as you like!

If you build something cool with these, let me know. I'd love to see it!

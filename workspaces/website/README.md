# Website

🌐 Welcome to my personal website and portfolio!

This site is built with Next.js and showcases my work, skills, and projects. It's a place for me to share what I'm passionate about and connect with others.

## Getting Started

To run the site locally:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Then visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see it in action.

## Project Structure

- `src/components/` — UI sections and widgets
- `src/gql-client/` — GraphQL client for fetching data

## Deployment

Deploying is a breeze with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or your platform of choice.
